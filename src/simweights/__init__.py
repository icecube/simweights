"""Pure python library for calculating the weights of Monte Carlo simulation for IceCube.

SimWeights was designed with goal of calculating weights for IceCube simulation in a way that it
is easy to combine combine datasets with different generation parameters into a single sample.
It was also designed to be a stand alone project which does not depend on IceTray in any way so that it can
be installed easily on laptops. SimWeights gathers all the information it needs form information in the
hdf5 file so there is no need for access to the simulation production database. SimWeights works with
files produced with corsika-reader, neutrino-generator, and genie-reader.
